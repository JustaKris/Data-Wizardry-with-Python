# Python Analytics Playground

A comprehensive training repository for colleagues transitioning from R and SPSS to Python and pandas. This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks and detailed documentation to help you master Python for data analytics.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- **R users** looking to add Python to their toolkit
- **SPSS users** transitioning to open-source analytics
- **Anyone** wanting to learn modern Python data analysis workflows

## 📚 What's Inside

### Jupyter Notebooks
Interactive tutorials covering:
- Python basics and syntax
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Statistical analysis with scipy and statsmodels
- Real-world analytics workflows

### Documentation Site
Comprehensive guides built with MkDocs:
- Installation and setup instructions
- Quickstart guides
- Side-by-side comparisons (R vs Python, SPSS vs Python)
- Reference materials and cheat sheets

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
